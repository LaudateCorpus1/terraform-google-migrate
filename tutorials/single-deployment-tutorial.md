# Terraform Google Cloud Migrate


## Let's get started!

This guide will show you how to deploy the infrastructure required for Migrate using Terraform and Cloud Foundation Toolkit.

**Time to complete**: About 1 hour

Click the **Start** button to move to the next step.


## Cloning the repository

Let's get started by cloning the git repo Migrate Cloud Foundations Toolkit repository inorder to use the provided examples.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-migrate
```

Let's navigate to the cloned repo and into the examples.
We will be using the single_deployment example in this walkthrough.

```bash
cd terraform-google-migrate/examples/single_deployment
```
## Creating the service account
TODO: Make a shell script to automate this.

## Exploring the Terraform code and setting variables

The <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="terraform-google-migrate/examples/single_deployment/main.tf" text="main.tf"></walkthrough-editor-open-file> file defines infrastructure that will be created.

The  <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="terraform-google-migrate/examples/single_deployment/variables.tf" text="variables.tf"></walkthrough-editor-open-file> file defines variables like billing account, subnet ips etc that will be used. 

The <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="terraform-google-migrate/examples/single_deployment/outputs.tf" text="outputs.tf"></walkthrough-editor-open-file> file defines what outputs Terraform will provide us. This includes service account emails that will be used for deploying the Migrate frontend.

Let's create a ```terraform.tfvars``` and set some of variables necessary to deploy the infrastructure.

```bash
touch terraform.tfvars
```

The following variables needs to be set in the <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="terraform-google-migrate/examples/single_deployment/terraform.tfvars" text="terraform.tfvars"></walkthrough-editor-open-file> file
```terraform
organization_id     = "YOUR ORG ID"
billing_account     = "YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT"
credentials_path    = "PATH TO YOUR SERVICE ACCOUNT JSON FILE"
per_folder_admins   = ["user:USER@DOMAIN.com", "group:GROUP@DOMAIN.com"]
all_folder_admins   = ["user:USER@DOMAIN.com", "group:GROUP@DOMAIN.com"]
subnet_01_ip        = "CIDR IP ADDRESS"
subnet_02_ip        = "CIDR IP ADDRESS"
subnet_03_ip        = "CIDR IP ADDRESS"
secondary_s01_range = "CIDR IP ADDRESS"
secondary_s02_range = "CIDR IP ADDRESS"
secondary_s03_range = "CIDR IP ADDRESS"
subnet_01_region    = "REGION FOR SUBNET"
subnet_02_region    = "REGION FOR SUBNET"
subnet_03_region    = "REGION FOR SUBNET"
local_subnet_01_ip  = "CIDR IP ADDRESS"
router_region       = "REGION FOR CLOUD ROUTER"
vpn_region          = "REGION FOR VPN"
```

**Tip**: Clicking on the files will open then in the cloud editor.

Next, we will deploy infrastructure with Terraform


## Deploying infrastructure with Terraform

Let's start by initializing Terraform. This will download the necessary modules and initialize Terraform.
```bash
terraform init
```

Now, we can plan the infrastructure. This will show you the changes Terraform intends to make to the current state for your infrastructure.
```bash
terraform plan --out=plan.out
```
Finally, we can apply the above planned infrastructure to create it in GCP.

```bash
terraform apply "plan.out"
```


## Congratulations

Youâ€™re all set!

Now you can deploy the Migrate frontend from the marketplace.
